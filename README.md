# Number Randomizer

## Overview
Number Randomizer is a front-end web application that generates random numbers based on user-defined parameters. The user specifies the amount of numbers to be generated and the minimum and maximum bounds of the range, and the application produces the results immediately through a clear and controlled interface.

This project was intentionally designed as a practice-oriented engineering exercise, focusing on JavaScript fundamentals, programming logic, DOM manipulation, and the ability to structure, document, and publish a clean front-end project on GitHub following professional standards and in English.

## Engineering Objectives
- Strengthen core JavaScript fundamentals and logical reasoning  
- Practice DOM manipulation and browser event handling  
- Implement input validation and basic state management  
- Apply separation of concerns between structure, style, and logic  
- Develop the habit of writing clear and professional documentation for GitHub repositories  

---

## Functional Scope
- Configurable quantity of random numbers  
- Customizable minimum and maximum values  
- Dynamic constraint enforcement between input fields  
- Random number generation within a closed interval  
- Immediate rendering of results in the user interface  
- Controlled reset mechanism to restore the application state  
- Defensive validation against invalid or empty inputs

## Technology Stack
- HTML5 – semantic structure and accessibility  
- CSS3 – layout, visual hierarchy, and UI states  
- Vanilla JavaScript – application logic and DOM control

## Usage Instructions
1. Enter the number of values to be generated  
2. Define the lower bound of the range  
3. Define the upper bound of the range  
4. Trigger the draw using the Sort button  
5. Use Restart to reset the inputs and results

## Technical Takeaways
- Clear separation between UI rendering and business logic  
- Use of reusable, single-responsibility functions  
- Safe handling of user input and edge cases  
- Practical experience managing application state in a small-scale project  
- Exposure to documenting technical decisions in a concise format

## Potential Enhancements
- Prevent duplicated values in the generated output  
- Introduce visual feedback or transitions during the draw process  
- Improve responsiveness for smaller screens  
- Extend the logic to support advanced draw rules  
- Add automated tests for core functions
